    dns.providers.lego_deprecated is a shim module that allows any and all of the
    DNS providers in go-acme/lego to be used with Caddy. They must
    be configured via environment variables, they do not support
    cancellation in the case of frequent config changes.

    Even though this module is in the dns.providers namespace, it
    is only a special case for solving ACME challenges, intended to
    replace the modules that used to be in the now-defunct tls.dns
    namespace. Using it in other places of the Caddy config will
    result in errors.

    This module will eventually go away in favor of the modules that
    make use of the libdns APIs: https://github.com/libdns

    http.reverse_proxy.transport.http_ntlm proxies HTTP with NTLM authentication.
    It basically wraps HTTPTransport so that it is compatible with
    NTLM's HTTP-hostile requirements. Specifically, it will use
    HTTPTransport's single, default *http.Transport for all requests
    (unless the client's connection is already mapped to a different
    transport) until a request comes in with an Authorization header
    that has "NTLM" or "Negotiate"; when that happens, NTLMTransport
    maps the client's connection (by its address, req.RemoteAddr)
    to a new transport that is used only by that downstream conn.
    When the upstream connection is closed, the mapping is deleted.
    This preserves NTLM authentication contexts by ensuring that
    client connections use the same upstream connection. It does
    hurt performance a bit, but that's NTLM for you.

    This transport also forces HTTP/1.1 and Keep-Alives in order
    for NTLM to succeed.

    It is basically the same thing as
    [nginx's paid ntlm directive](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#ntlm)
    (but is free in Caddy!).

    http.matchers.conneg matches requests by comparing results of a
    content negotiation process to a (list of) values.

    Lists of media types, languages, charsets, and encodings to match
    the request against can be given - and at least one of them MUST
    be specified.
    OPTIONAL parameters are a strings for identifying URL query string
    parameter keys that allow requests to override/skip the connection
    negotiation process and force a media type, a language, a charset
    or an encoding (all defaulting to '').
    The values of query string parameter values corresponding to full
    media types (languages, encodings, etc.) are hardcoded in a
    variable called `aliases` below

    COMPATIBILITY NOTE: This module is still experimental and is not
    subject to Caddy's compatibility guarantee.

    http.matchers.remote_host matches based on the remote IP of the
    connection. A host name can be specified, whose A and AAAA
    DNS records will be resolved to a corresponding IP for matching.

    Note that IPs can sometimes be spoofed, so do not rely
    on this as a replacement for actual authentication.

    http.handlers.gopkg implements vanity go package import paths.

    Vanity go package import paths give a cleaner appearance to go projects by separating the source code location from
    the import path. It also gives flexibility to developers by allowing them to change a project's source code hosting
    platform without requiring the project to be renamed. Finally, it allows projects hosted on various platforms to be
    grouped under a common import path.
